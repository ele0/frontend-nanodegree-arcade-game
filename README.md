# Frogger: frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
-----------------------------------------

An implementation of the Frogger game for the Udacity Nanodegree. In this version, the player needs to reach the water without colliding with any bugs.

## Install
* Clone this repo or download and unpack the zip file.

## Playing the game
The goal is to get your player across the paved road to the water on the other side as many times as you can without touching any bugs.
Once you select the character, move left, right, up or down while dodging bugs that move with varying speeds across on the road.

Each successful attempt to reach the water increases your score by 1.

Each round of the game starts with 3 lives. If the player collides with a bug, the game is reset and the player restarts from the initial position and 1 life is taken away. Once your player loses 3 lives, the game is over.

# Frogger: frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
-----------------------------------------

An implementation of the Frogger game for the Udacity Nanodegree. In this version, the player needs to reach the water without colliding with any bugs.

## Install
* Clone this repo or download and unpack the zip file.

## Playing the game
The goal is to get your player across the paved road to the water on the other side without touching any bugs.
Once you select the character, move left, right, up or down while dodging bugs that move with varying speeds across on the road.

If the player collides with a bug, the game is reset and the player restarts.

- **Launch** the game by loading index.html in your browser (double click the file)
- Type a number between 1 & 5 to select the character you wish to use
- Use the directional keys to move your player and avoid the bugs
- Pause or resume the game from a paused state by hitting "Spacebar"
